This is a modernisation fork by [onegen][4] of [`darktohka/audacious-plugin-rpc`][3],
(made in 2018, abandoned in 2022) by [Derzsi D√°niel][5] et al.
It migrates the IPC protocol and header from the deprecated [`discord/discord-rpc`][6]
to the newer [Discord Game SDK][7].\
With the new SDK, it can make use of the new `LISTENING` activity type,
showing a progress bar and ‚ÄúListening to Audacious‚Äù status.
