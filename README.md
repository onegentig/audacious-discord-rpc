# Audacious Discord RPC

Discord Rich Presence (RPC) plugin for [Audacious][1]! \
Displays what you‚Äôre vibing to in your Discord profile. üßë‚Äçüé§üé∂

This is a modernisation fork by [onegen][4] of [`darktohka/audacious-plugin-rpc`][3],
which was maintained between 2018 and 2022 by [Derzsi D√°niel][5] et al.
It migrates the IPC protocol and header from the [`discord/discord-rpc`][6]
deprecated in 2019 to the newer [Discord Game SDK][7].\
It makes use of the new `LISTENING` activity type, shows a progress bar
and I just think it looks better.

This program is a free and source-available software,
with the fork‚Äôs additions open-sourced under the [MIT licence][8].

- <span title="Too long; didn‚Äôt read; not a lawyer">TL;DR;NAL</span>: Do absolutely whatever you want with the code, just include the LICENCE file if you re-distribute it.
- See [`LICENCE`](./LICENCE) file or [tl;drLegal][9] for more details.

The code from the [original repository][3] is *without a licence*.
The author(s) [have been prompted][10] to add one, but the repository is effectively abandoned
and my the request was ignored (at the time of writing, at least). \
In general, code related to Discord RPC/IPC is [this fork][2]‚Äôs own work (MIT)
while code registering the plugin with Audacious is from the original repository (unlicensed).
