This is a modernisation fork by [onegen][4] of [`darktohka/audacious-plugin-rpc`][3]
(made in 2018, abandoned in 2022) by [Derzsi D√°niel][5] [et al.][11] \
It migrates the plugin from the deprecated [`discord/discord-rpc`][6]
to the modernised [`EclipseMenu/discord-presence`][12], allowing it to use
the new `LISTENING` activity type (‚ÄúListening to...‚Äù) and a progress bar.

## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is *made for GNU/Linux* systems and is not tested for Windows or Mac.
> Furthermore, it is *not possible* to install this plugin on sandboxed immutable
> distributions of Audacious like Flatpak or Snap.

This plugin is not included in the official [Audacious plugins][13], so it has to be
added to the Audacious plugin directory manually. Audacious is usually installed
system-wide, so administrator privilages will likely be required.

1. **Get the `discord-rpc.so` file.** You can find the latest
     released version in the [releases][2] section. Alternatively, you can
     build it from source yourself (req. `audacious-dev` aka `audacious-devel`
     installed system-wide):

     ```sh
     git clone git@github.com:onegentig/audacious-discord-rpc.git
     cd audacious-discord-rpc
     cmake -S . -B build
     cmake --build build -j # Built file: build/discord-rpc.so
     ```

2. **Find the plugin directory.** (Not necessary for manual builds, see below.)
     Run the following command to find out where to put the plugin file:

     ```sh
     echo "$(pkg-config --variable=plugin_dir audacious)/General"
     ```

     Or if you‚Äôre using nushell:

     ```nushell
     $"(pkg-config --variable=plugin_dir audacious)/General"
     ```

     As it will likely print a system directory in `/usr`,
     moving the plugin fill will require admin privilages.

3. **Move the file.** If you downloaded the `discord-rpc.so` from a release,
     move the file to the directory from the previous step. Simple `cp`:

     ```sh
     sudo cp ~/Downloads/discord-rpc.so $(pkg-config --variable=plugin_dir audacious)/General/
     ```

     If you built the plugin yourself, run this command instead:

     ```sh
     sudo cmake --install build
     ```

     This internally calls the `pkg-config` command and does it all for you. Big thanks to
     [Sturmlilie](https://github.com/Sturmlilie) for implementing this!

4. **Enable the plugin.** In Audacious, open ‚ÄòServices‚Äô on the top menu, then
     open ‚ÄòPlug-Ins‚Äô and in the ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô tab, you should see ‚ÄòDiscord RPC‚Äô as shown
     on the screenshot below. Checking the box will enable the plugin. The plugin has
     a few configurable options, which you can change by clicking ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô with the
     plugin highlighted.

If you encounter any issues or crashes, please, open an [issue][10]! I *want* this to work so
if something is broken, I‚Äôll do my best to fix it. Alternatively, if you‚Äôre good with C++,
and feel like helping out, check if you can‚Äôt fix something yourself. PRs are always appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the plugin, simply delete the `discord-rpc.so` file from the Audacious
‚ÄúGeneral plugins‚Äù directory (see step 2 of [Installation](#installation) above).
A quick shell command:

```sh
sudo rm $(pkg-config --variable=plugin_dir audacious)/General/discord-rpc.so
```

‚Ä¶on nushell:

```nushell
sudo rm $"(pkg-config --variable=plugin_dir audacious)/General/discord-rpc.so"
```

Also, if you used the [older (original) version][3] of the plugin (pre-fork), you
might want to delete that file too. The older file was called `libaudacious-plugin-rpc.so`.

```sh
sudo rm $(pkg-config --variable=plugin_dir audacious)/General/libaudacious-plugin-rpc.so
```

‚Ä¶on nushell:

```nushell
sudo rm $"(pkg-config --variable=plugin_dir audacious)/General/libaudacious-plugin-rpc.so"
```
